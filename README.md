# PHP test

## 1. Installation

  - create an empty database named "product" on your MySQL server
  - import the dbdump.sql in the "product" database
  - put your MySQL server credentials in the constructor of DB class

## 2. Expectations

This simple application works, but with very old-style monolithic codebase, so do anything you want with it, to make it:

  - easier to work with
  - more maintainable
